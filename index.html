                ** spoiler alert ** If I could give this book more than five stars, I absolutely would. I had stopped writing reviews for a while, but this book made such an impact that I couldn't resist sharing my thoughts. My heart raced with every pageI felt like I was right there alongside Kitt, Iris, Attie, and Marisol, living their journey with them. And Roman Kitt? I adore him. I adored every moment between him and Iris. Despite the chaos around them the war, the loss, the despair love remained a constant force, lighting up even the darkest moments. This book made me believe that love can truly hold people together, no matter what. When Roman and Iris were separated, my heart sank. You know that feeling when something hits so deep it makes you physically sick? That was me. And honestly, I love that books can make me feel this way it means I’m completely immersed, fully connected to the characters. This book did that to me. I originally planned to take my time before diving into the second book, but after finishing this one, I just can’t wait any longer. I need to know what happens next. And please Roman has to survive. He deserves it.
If you’re wondering whether to read this book, my answer is a resounding YES. I’d recommend this book a hundred times over. It’s the kind of story that stays with you long after you’ve turned the last page.
